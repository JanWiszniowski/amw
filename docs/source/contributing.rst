Anthropogenic Mw estimation development happens on
`GitHub <https://github.com/JanWiszniowski/amw>`_.

This is a new solution. So, I'm very open to contributions: if you have new ideas, please open an
`Issue <https://github.com/JanWiszniowski/amw/issues>`_.
Don't hesitate to send me pull requests with new features and/or bugfixes!
