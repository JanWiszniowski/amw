Core modules
############

Core modules are used in the Anthropogenic Mw package,
but are designated for more general use, therefor the are described separately.

The arclink_client.py is located the core utils.
Because it is now obsolete but still used in some seismic networks,
it is taken from the older version of ObsPy and put in the core subdirectory.
